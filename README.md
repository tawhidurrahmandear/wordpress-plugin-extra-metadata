## How to do this?
This is my own PlugIn, just replace information with yours  <br>

* To ensure WordPress ecosystem, folder-name, main-plugin-file-name.php, and text-domain should be same. Please replace special-promotion-and-support with yours 
* Replace specialpromotion with your pluginname 
* Replace tawhidurrahmandear with your WordPress.org developer ID. My WordPress URL is https://profiles.wordpress.org/tawhidurrahmandear and username is tawhidurrahmandear which means if I use tawhidurrahmandear everywhere, there is no chance of conflicts.
